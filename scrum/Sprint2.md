# 3. Sprint Ceremonies Insights

## Daily Scrum (Stand-Up Meetings)

> Our team had discussions on Zoom every two days. We also held on-site meetings on campus every Friday.
> Updates included progress on front-end code, specifically login, sign up, and reset password pages, and backlog creation in Trello.
> We identified blockers (like confusion about Scrum , INVEST and DEEP) and resolved them through quick follow-up discussions.

## Sprint Planning

**Purpose:**  
To define what features and deliverables we’ll complete during Sprint 2 and how we’ll divide responsibilities.

**Scope:**

- Create the **Login, Register, and Forget Password page**
- Create the **API Endpoint for user account management**
- Update the **Product Backlog** in Trello
- Write the **Scrum Ceremony Insights**

**Approach:**  
We reviewed user stories, estimated effort (story points), and prioritized them using the DEEP and INVEST principles.
Tasks were distributed as per member expertise using Trello.

## Sprint Retrospective

**Purpose:**  
To reflect on what went well, what didn’t, and what can be improved for the next sprint.

**Outcome:**

- **Liked:**
  Successful implementation of registration and login forms connected to the backend. <br>
  Improved collaboration between front‑end and back‑end teams. <br>
  Consistent communication during daily scrums helped resolve blockers quickly.

- **Learned:**
  Gained practical experience in connecting front‑end forms to backend APIs. <br>
  Learned how to test endpoints effectively using Postman collections. <br>
  Better understanding of database schema design and AI endpoint integration.

- **Lacked:**
  Dashboard development was postponed, leaving some UI features incomplete. <br>
  Limited time for thorough testing and debugging across all components. <br>
  Some uncertainty in dividing tasks evenly among members.

- **Longed For:**
  Earlier start on dashboard implementation to align faster with the prototype. <br>
  More detailed task breakdowns with clear ownership to avoid overlaps. <br>
  Additional mid‑sprint reviews to catch delays before they accumulate. you can do some edits
