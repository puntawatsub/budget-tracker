# 2. Project Description

The Smart Budget App is a simple and user-friendly web application designed to help individuals effectively manage their personal finances. It allows users to record their income and expenses, categorize transactions, and monitor their spending habits over time. The app provides clear visual summaries of financial data, such as charts and balance overviews, enabling users to make informed decisions about their budgets.

With this application, users can easily track where their money goes, set financial goals, and plan for future expenses. The intuitive design ensures accessibility for users with varying levels of technical experience. The ultimate aim of the Smart Budget App is to promote better money management, financial awareness, and savings habits among its users.

## Target users and stakeholders

7. **Summary Reports**
   • Generates summaries showing total income, total expenses and savings for selected time periods.  
   • Allows uses to analyse their financial trends and make informed decisions.

## User stories and product backlog

The Smart Budget App is designed to help users easily manage and track their personal finances. To ensure the application meets user needs, we created detailed user stories that describe what users expect to achieve through the app. Each user story focuses on specific goals, such as adding income or expenses, setting a monthly budget, viewing spending summaries, and tracking savings progress.

We also organized our product backlog using Trello, which helped us plan, assign, and monitor each task efficiently throughout development. Our Trello board was divided into columns — Backlog, To Do, In Progress, and Done — representing the workflow from idea to completion. This structure allowed the team to collaborate effectively, prioritize features, and maintain a clear overview of project progress.

### User Stories

The following user stories describe the main functionalities of the Smart Budget App from the user’s perspective:  
• As a user, I want to create an account, so my data is saved securely.  
• As a user, I want to log in/out, so I can access my personal dashboard.  
• As a user, I want to reset my password if I forget it.  
• As a user, I want to add income records.

To reflect on what went well, what didn’t, and what can be improved for the next sprint.

**Outcome:**  
What went well: Team communication and task division. <br />
What could improve: Better time scheduling.<br />
Action for next sprint: Assign deadlines per task and review mid-week.
