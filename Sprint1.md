## (4) USER STORIES AND PRODUCT BACKLOG

The Smart Budget App is designed to help users easily manage and track their personal finances. To ensure the application meets user needs, we created detailed user stories that describe what users expect to achieve through the app. Each user story focuses on specific goals, such as adding income or expenses, setting a monthly budget, viewing spending summaries, and tracking savings progress.

We also organized our product backlog using Trello, which helped us plan, assign, and monitor each task efficiently throughout development. Our Trello board was divided into columns — Backlog, To Do, In Progress, and Done — representing the workflow from idea to completion. This structure allowed the team to collaborate effectively, prioritize features, and maintain a clear overview of project progress.
